# Java Design Patterns

A collection of **classic design pattern implementations in Java**, organized by **creational**, **structural**, and **behavioral** categories.  
This project serves as a reference and learning resource, with clean, well-structured examples and demonstrations.

## ðŸ§© Pattern Descriptions

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton** â†’ Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.  
- **Prototype** â†’ Creates new objects by cloning existing ones instead of instantiating from scratch.  
- **Factory Method** â†’ Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  
- **Abstract Factory** â†’ Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.  
- **Builder** â†’ Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing different configurations.  

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter** â†’ Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect, enabling incompatible interfaces to work together.  
- **Bridge** â†’ Decouples abstraction from implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.  
- **Composite** â†’ Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies; clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.  
- **Decorator** â†’ Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects without modifying their code.  
- **Facade** â†’ Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces, making a subsystem easier to use.  
- **Flyweight** â†’ Reduces memory usage by sharing common state between multiple objects instead of storing it repeatedly.  
- **Proxy** â†’ Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access, add security, or manage resources.  

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Strategy** â†’ Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.  
- **Observer** â†’ Establishes a one-to-many dependency so when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.  
- **Command** â†’ Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization, queuing, logging, and undoable operations.  
- **Chain of Responsibility** â†’ Passes requests along a chain of handlers until one processes it, promoting loose coupling.  
- **Template Method** â†’ Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.  
- **State** â†’ Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.  
- **Iterator** â†’ Provides a way to sequentially access elements of a collection without exposing its internal structure.  
- **Mediator** â†’ Encapsulates interactions between objects, reducing direct dependencies and promoting loose coupling.  
- **Memento** â†’ Captures an objectâ€™s internal state without violating encapsulation so it can be restored later.  
- **Interpreter** â†’ Defines a grammar for a language and provides an interpreter to evaluate its sentences.  
- **Visitor** â†’ Separates operations from the object structure, allowing new operations to be added without modifying existing classes.
